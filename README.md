# Eye Open/Closed Detection using OpenCV 👁️  

This project uses **OpenCV** and Haar Cascade classifiers to detect whether a person’s eyes are **open or closed** in real-time through a webcam.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- Real-time webcam feed for detecting eyes.  
- Haarcascade-based eye detection.  
- Uses **aspect ratio** of the detected eye region to determine if eyes are **open or closed**.  
- Displays bounding boxes and labels ("Eyes Open" / "Eyes Closed").  
- Press **Q** to quit the program.
